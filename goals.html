<h1>Goals and Aspirations</h1>

I would like to finish my 4 year college degree, and graduate from the Maine Business. Then after that I think I would probably apply for Chick-fil-A's leadership development program. This programs is for people to become LDP Operators and have their own store. This program consists of me traveling from Grand Opening to Grand Opening, for two years straight. Then after that you would be a likely candidate for a store.
