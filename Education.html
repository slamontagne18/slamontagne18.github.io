<h1>Education</h1>

<h2>Bangor High School</h2>

<ul>
    <li> I grew up going through the Bangor School System. I really enjoyed going to school when I was younger, and really liked my teachers through my elementary and middle school years. I started going to Bangor High School in Fall of 2014, which was my Freshman year. This first year was definitely a change for me from middle school to high school. Getting used to it my first year wasn't too bad but, after the first couple years I decided I didn't really enjoy High School, and thought I might enjoy college better. When people say, “High school is such a good time, enjoy it and live in the moment.” Probably right after Sophpmore year I was very eager to start college. I feel like the reason I didn’t enjoy high school though was because I felt like I was being micromanaged by my teachers, and I feel that I was more mature then some other people in my classes so some students and even some teachers were just sort of a nuisance. But I eventually graduated from Bangor High School in July of 2018 and was ready to start my new adventure at the University of Maine.</li>

<h2>University of Maine</h2>

<ul>
    <li>It was only about six months before graduation from high school, before I knew what I wanted to do. I always enjoyed film since I was younger and I thought that is what I wanted to do for a long time. About six months before I graduated, I decided I wanted to do business  </li>
